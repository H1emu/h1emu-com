      Why we started
    </h5>
    <p class="mb-3 font-normal text-gray-400">
      The motivation behind this project came from a simple statement: "It's
      just a matter of effort and enough interest from people to make private
      servers for the game." Many doubted that there was still a community for
      H1Z1: Just Survive, but we took that challenge head-on. And here we are,
      proving them wrong, one line of code at a time.
